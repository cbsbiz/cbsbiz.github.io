At CBS we are not big fans of bids or quotes.. we don't believe in wasting your time. In most cases when we are talking with a new client they inform us that they will be getting four or five different quotes. Let's face it, NO ONE LIKES A SALESMAN why would you want to deal with four or five!? With CBS you get to tell us what YOU want to pay and if we can't meet your needs, we WILL tell you! You don't get any smoke in your ears when you are dealing with us. Give us a call or shoot an email if you are interested in meeting some people that would rather just talk than sell you anything. Check the bottom left corner of the webpage for the contact information!
