For the last few weeks it has been almost impossible for me to write anything in this blog. Mostly because there is a high demand for Copiers and Printers during this month and who better to buy from than yours truly, here @ CBS. Now that I have thawed out just enough to address my reading public I bid you all a Happy New Year and would like to thank everyone who has come on board this month as a new customer and a part of our family. Now I present to you...(drum roll)... Our brand new Facebook page!

Thank you in advance for visiting the new Facebook page!
