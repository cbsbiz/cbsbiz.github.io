This week and this week only! CBS know's that you are not happy with the current equipment in your office. We also know that sometimes it is hard to break away from your current vendor, you just don't want to hurt anyone's feelings and we understand that. Right now, if you buy a new Bizhub from CBS we will provide a few sticks of dynamite that can be inserted into your current machine! This will allow for a great reason to call the current vendor and tell him you switched to CBS! When they ask why just tell them that their copier blew up! You had no choice!

*Please make sure that Insurance will cover the explosion before inquiring*
