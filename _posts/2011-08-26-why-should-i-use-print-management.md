I don't know... Why should you? How many printers are in your office? Do you buy cartridges for them? Do they ever break? Do you ever have to replace any of them with a new printer? If you said yes to any of those questions  you have a chance to qualify for our product. But, more importantly, would you rather your employees do the job you pay them for (hourly) or would you rather them try to constantly have to deal with these devices? Do you feel like you are paying to much for toner and ink? If there was an option to save money you probably would not be interested, right? Do you ever wonder if there is a better way than buying a $299.00 printer every 6 months to a year? We might not be the right fit for your company when dealing with these needs but we don't charge to find out. So, you decide, our number is on the left hand side of this page or there are plenty of other websites you can be visiting right now.
