Some times it is the little things that count. Like holding equipment in our warehouse space for customers that have upgraded to our equipment and don't have a home for their old copier. Guess what? We will even do our best to re-sell the product to someone in need of a great deal. Heck, we will even split the profit with you! Maybe you should consider this small but helpful fact next time you are in the market for some office equipment. And if we can't sell it, there is always the baseball bat in the parking lot option. Maybe we could sell tickets! $1.00 gets you two swings at the old copier!
