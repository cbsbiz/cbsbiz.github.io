Here at CBS we believe in feeding our employees, at-least once a week.. Every Friday @ CBS we order a few pizza's from Stone Creek Pizza CO. in Port St. John. If you would like to stop in and try to grab a slice before any of the technicians can get their hands on them. Or you could call and let us know you are coming down so we can order enough, please feel free!

And don't forget we give away a free toner cartridges to the 50th person to come through our door ever Friday! Get in on it!
