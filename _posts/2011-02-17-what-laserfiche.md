Sounds delicious right? Imagine, you walk inside the front doors of an elegant restaurant "table for two" you say with a calm tone as the atmosphere overwhelms your emotions. The waiter comes to your table and asks "would you like to try our house special, the Laserfiche?" you respond "yes, we will take two". This is all wrong. Laserfiche comes no where close in taste to the fancy items at your favorite restaurant. However, it could keep your favorite restaurant from going out of business if a hurricane rolled through or one of the cooks created a grease fire that burnt down the entire building. Maybe it would be worth your time to come and see what it is I am talking about. Here at CBS we give a complimentary demo with lunch (no Laserfiche is served) that will educate you further on the world of Document Imaging and our Laserfiche Suite.
