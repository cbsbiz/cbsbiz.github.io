To our customer's we simply say, Thank You. During this time of the year we all have the opportunity to reflect and an even better opportunity to buy your loved ones a Konica Minolta Bizhub C35 which is our newest color product to hit the market. Affordable, small footprint, great color. What else could say Merry Christmas with this much meaning!! Give us a shout now to get some free information also... if you call now we have candy... and you can get in on it!
