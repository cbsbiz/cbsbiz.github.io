### Below is a testimony from D.L. Evans Bank:

In a year marked with more bank failures than we’ve seen since the height of the savings-and-loan crisis, D.L. Evans Bank, a family-owned institution with 22 branches, 320 employees and $875 million in managed assets, has cause to celebrate. Its ten-year use of Laserfiche has netted the 105-year-old, Idaho-based bank a wealth of dividends, including:

* Faster audits.
* Streamlined lending.
* Improved business continuity planning.
* More efficient processes for opening new accounts.
* A 33% reduction in hard copy document production and an 85% reduction in paper storage.

<u>Original Pain Points: Data Storage and Accessibility</u>

When Tato Munoz joined D.L. Evans as IT director in 1998, one of the first challenges he set out to tackle was the bank’s approach to data storage. "With the incredible amount of information we had, keeping everything accessible and knowing where it was all located at any given time was difficult," he says.

At first, the bank considered simply finding a more efficient way to manage its paper-based documents. However, as Munoz explains, "That wasn’t really an option because we were filling up our secure storage facilities pretty fast." At the time, the bank’s storage space included a 20×13 room, a 12×12 vault and an off-site warehouse. According to Munoz, “Keeping track of what was due for disposition, finding it in that crowded warehouse and then shredding it all was a nightmare."

In addition to the headache associated with storing paper records, Munoz knew that paper was a frighteningly fragile medium, and he wanted to ensure that records would be accessible even in the face of tragedy or natural disaster. "If we gave documents to an auditor and he got into a car crash and the documents were destroyed, we had no back-ups," he says. "It would have been extremely detrimental to our business."

To break the bank’s reliance on paper records without breaking the IT budget, Munoz began investigating enterprise content management solutions.
