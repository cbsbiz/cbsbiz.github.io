Our product has monitored tens of thousands of servers and has developed best practice fixes. These best practice fixes have been integrated into IntelliMonitors, which analyze the server environment. Depending on the server conditions, specific alerts are raised and escalated to our technicians and the NOC with steps to resolution. Several failed events and/or services could take hours to properly diagnose. CBS provides your resolution within minutes.
